  One thing I think is interesting that the court goes out of its way to point
  out is that the judge does not conclude that there was any ill motive or
  intentional misconduct on the part of the police who interrogated Dassey,"
  Suter remarks. "I think that observation is especially interesting given all
  of the allegations of corruption in this case."The state has 90 days to appeal
  the ruling to the federal Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in which case,
  Duffin's judgement will be stayed – the legal equivalent of hitting 'pause' –
  and Dassey will be in limbo, and still in prison, until the Seventh Circuit
  weighs in. So while Dassey's family and supporters are right to celebrate, it
  might be awhile before he can join the party.Regardless, the renewed buzz
  around the case won't be dying down anytime soon. Attorney Kathleen Zellner,
  who took on Avery's case in January, was granted an extension for filing
  Avery's appeal, which is now due by August 29. For the last seven months,
  Zellner has been uniquely vocal about the exhaustive steps she has taken to
  prove her client's innocence. She's tweeted numerous accusations that police
  planted evidence, hinted at possible alternative suspects and alluded to new
  evidence that proves Avery couldn't have killed Halbach. With 17 exonerations
  under her belt, Zellner has pledged to make Avery her 18th and has said there
  will be no need for a retrial. Unless Zellner has suddenly become all bark and
  no bite, the brief she files at the end of the month is expected to be a
  jaw-dropper. No wonder Making A Murderer's cameras have already started
  rolling on season two.
