<p>I’ll let
you into a little secret: I really don’t care about my Facebook Newsfeed. Or
Twitter. If Instagram had an algorithm that sorted out the decent pictures
from…all the rest, I’d likely spend more time there than I do. Don’t get me
wrong: it’s not that I’m not interested in your life; it’s just that I have my
own. And it takes up a lot of my time.</p><p>Of course, once
in a while, I will check-in with you and make the effort to find out what
you’ve been up to. I’m not a monster, you know. I’ll glance through the most
recent posts in my feed every couple of days. I’ll check a couple of profiles
and see what people have been posting. </p><p>Just
like you, I found out about Alan Rickman and David Bowie dying from social
media rather than traditional media.</p><p>I’ve made a
deliberate decision not to let the digital world freak me out. As I write this
there are 26,649 unread messages in my Gmail account. By the time you read this
it will certainly be more. It shocks some people, it makes them profoundly
uncomfortable. I’ve been asked, with concern, if I’m scared I’ve missed
anything.</p><p>Not remotely.
Important messages go to one account, the ephemera of my online life goes to
Gmail.</p><p>Google made me a promise: I would
never have to delete another thing. So, I haven’t. Not a single message in all
the years the account has been active. It’s all there should I feel the need to
search for something. </p><p>The
Internet and the technology that connects us to it – broadband, WiFi, computers
and phones – will undoubtedly go down as a milestone in the development of our
species; one that is every bit as big as the discovery of fire, or the
invention of the wheel. It has unlocked information, making it democratic and
available.</p><p>Perhaps we
weren’t ready. Like pulp fiction, where the rogue scientist goes madly
villainous after aliens transfer the secrets of the universe to his brain,
information overload is sending us all quietly insane. My Inbox clocks up close
to 50 ignoble emails a day. Newsletters, special offers, reminders from some
long forgotten service.</p><p>At the same
time, social media makes our friends’ lives seem so much interesting than our
own, forcing us into an arms race for Likes. Just as pornographers compete to
invent and exploit ever more extreme niches of human sexuality – see the
twisted minds behind tentacle porn – so we feel the need to constantly reinvent
and push our own boundaries. Cancel that Netflix marathon, your followers want wingsuit
paintball. With bears.</p><p>Admittedly,
that’s not a normal scenario. Getting a bear into a wingsuit requires days of
meticulous planning. But there are plenty of people doing stupid things in the
name of amusing their friends on Facebook. Ask the guy who almost drowned after
jumping off Tower Bridge into London’s River Thames. He did it as a dare. And more
than a dozen people died taking selfies last year. In Russia it’s considered
such a problem that the police have launched a campaign to tackle it. </p><p>It doesn’t
have to be this way. You don’t have to be scared of missing out; you can
celebrate it, instead. For the last couple of years a counter-movement has
quietly been gathering pace. Coined by entrepreneur and tech blogger Anil Dash,
the phrase Joy of Missing Out, JOMO for short, came to him when he was forced
to miss a Prince concert thanks to the birth of his son.</p><p>If you need
a night of binge watching, that will probably give you more pleasure than
schlepping around a crowded club, no matter how amazing the atmosphere. It’s
not missing out, it’s enjoying something else. Similarly, you don’t need to
scan the headlines and newsfeeds every few seconds. Your friends and their achievements
will still be there in the morning. As for the rest, well, bad news doesn’t go
anywhere fast.</p><p>You don’t
need to switch off. You don’t need to disconnect. You just need to treat the Web
like a crowded bar. It’s great to pop in and catch up with your friends a few
times a week, but you wouldn’t want to be the guy propping up the bar. He looks
like he’s been beaten by a bear. In a wingsuit.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 data-reactid="30"><a data-reactid="31">kulturpop</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="35"></div></section></div></div>
